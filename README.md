Notes for later:
  > Improve the random spawning, it's not actually random atm because it from the start, making the start more likely to have cells than the end
  > Combine all the separate moving functions into one with a direction argument, changing the cellAbove to whichever direction is specified
  > cont. place the checking for cells into a separate function, call that function in each loop!
